Challenges with General-Purpose GPUs

General-purpose GPUs often struggle with the sequential nature of Large Language Models (LLMs).
GPUs are designed for parallel processing, ideal for graphical computations but less efficient for sequential language data processing.
This mismatch results in slower inference speeds and hinders real-time capabilities.

Introduction to LPUs

LPUs (Language Processing Units) were introduced to address these inefficiencies.
Created by Jonathon Ross of Groq, LPUs focus on the sequential processing nature of natural languages.
Key features include:

On-chip high bandwidth SRAM memory to minimize data flow and reduce latency.
Customizable components based on model architecture (e.g., Mixture of Experts, sparsified attention, multi-node inference).



Groq&rsquo;s Approach

Architecture: Wide, slow, and low power, emphasizing parallelism with extensive local SRAM memory.
Memory: Uses super-fast, expensive SRAM, with each chip containing a small amount of memory compared to GPUs. Models are split across many chips.
Deterministic Design: Fully predictable VLIW architecture with no buffers, allowing precise operation scheduling down to the nanosecond.

Cerebras&rsquo; Approach

Architecture: CPUs with approximately 1 million cores, leveraging CPU caches for inference without network involvement.
Unique Design: Entirely different from traditional GPU architectures, focusing on massive parallelism within a single chip.

General Techniques for Optimized Inference

Trade-offs: Balance latency, throughput, and cost to maximize hardware value.
Batch Sizes: Adjust for performance; smaller batches for lower latency, larger batches for higher throughput.
Performance: Groq LPUs and Cerebras WFE Chips offer advantages in throughput, latency, and cost compared to Nvidia GPUs.


LPUs: Detailed Architecture

Processing Elements (PEs): Thousands of identical PEs arranged in SIMD arrays for parallel processing.
Centralized Control Unit (CU): Manages instructions and data flow, ensuring efficient resource utilization.
Memory Structure: Large on-chip SRAM and high-bandwidth off-chip memory (HBM) for quick data access.
Network-on-Chip (NoC): High-speed data and instruction highway connecting PEs, CU, and memory.
Vector Processing: Supports simultaneous operations on large datasets, crucial for complex computations.

How LPUs Operate

Data Input: The CU issues instructions to PEs.
Parallel Processing: PEs execute instructions on different data points concurrently.
Memory Access: Rapid data access ensures PEs are constantly fed with necessary data.
Coordination: The CU manages thousands of operations per clock cycle.
Data Movement: The NoC facilitates quick data and instruction movement.
Operation Units: PEs equipped with Arithmetic Logic Units, Vector Units, and Scalar Units for diverse operations.
