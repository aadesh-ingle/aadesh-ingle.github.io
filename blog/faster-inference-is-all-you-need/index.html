General purpose GPUs quite often struggle with the sequential nature of LLMs.
GPUs, with architectures prioritizing parallel processing, are ideal for handling numerous graphical computations simultaneously. However, LLMs operate differently—relying on sequential processing of language data. This mismatch between hardware and task creates inefficiencies, resulting in slower inference speeds and hindering real-time capabilities.
That’s when LPUs came into the picture, created by Jonathon Ross of Groq.

LPUs double down on the sequential processing nature of natural languages.
They have on-chip high bandwidth SRAM memory, which minimizes data flow and reduces latency.
You can customize specific components of the LPU chip depending on the model architecture type (MoE, sparsified attention, multi-node inference).


The Groq approach is wide, slow, and low power—making up for it in parallel across many units with lots of local SRAM memory next to the compute—while the Nvidia approach is faster on the matrix math and much faster on the main memory that is stacked up and running in parallel.
Groq, as far as I understand, is hardware made for AI that uses super fast, expensive memory (SRAM, the same kind used in the L3 cache of CPUs), and each Groq chip has only a tiny amount of memory compared to GPUs; they split the model across many chips.
Cerebras makes CPUs with ~1 million cores, and they&rsquo;re inferring on that instead of GPUs. It’s an entirely different architecture, meaning no network is involved—possibly leveraging CPU caches instead.


Groq’s chip has a fully deterministic VLIW (Very Long Instruction Word) architecture, with no buffers, and it reaches ~725mm² die size on Global Foundries’ 14nm process node. It has no external memory, keeping weights, KVCache, activations, etc., all on-chip during processing. Because each chip only has 230MB of SRAM, no useful models can actually fit on a single chip. Instead, many chips must be utilized and networked together."><meta name=author content="Aadesh Ingle"><meta name=keywords content><meta property="og:title" content="Faster Inference is All You Need!"><meta property="og:description" content="Leading players in the market:

Architecture Design</strong></h3><p><strong>Groq LPU:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Single Instruction, Multiple Data (SIMD):</strong> The LPU operates on a SIMD architecture, allowing thousands of PEs to execute the same instruction on different data points simultaneously. This design is specifically optimized for tensor operations, which are fundamental in AI and machine learning tasks.</li><li><strong>Centralized Control Unit:</strong> The LPU features a centralized control unit that manages instruction scheduling and data flow, ensuring efficient resource utilization. This enables deterministic behavior, with execution order that minimizes latency.</li><li><strong>On-Chip Memory:</strong> Groq&rsquo;s LPU integrates significant on-chip SRAM, providing high bandwidth (up to 80TB/s) and low-latency access to data. This reduces reliance on slower external memory accesses.</li></ul><p><strong>Traditional GPU:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Massively Parallel Architecture:</strong> GPUs are built with many smaller cores designed for parallel processing. They excel at handling multiple tasks simultaneously but rely on complex memory hierarchies and caching mechanisms to manage data flow.</li><li><strong>Distributed Control:</strong> GPUs typically use distributed control mechanisms with multiple levels of caches (L1, L2), which can introduce non-deterministic execution due to cache misses and memory contention.</li><li><strong>External Memory Dependency:</strong> While GPUs may have high off-chip memory bandwidth (e.g., GDDR6 or HBM), they depend heavily on external memory for data storage, leading to potential latency increases during data transfers.</li></ul><h2 id=2-performance-optimisation><strong>2. Performance Optimisation</strong></h2><p><strong>Groq LPU:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Deterministic Execution:</strong> The deterministic nature of the LPU allows for precise scheduling of operations down to the nanosecond—a crucial factor for low-latency applications like LLM inference.</li><li><strong>Optimised Data Reuse:</strong> Its architecture maximizes data reuse within on-chip memory, reducing energy consumption and enhancing performance by minimizing memory accesses.</li><li><strong>Pipelining and Vector Processing:</strong> The LPU employs pipelining techniques to process multiple operations concurrently at different execution stages. Each PE supports vector processing, enabling efficient handling of tensor operations.</li></ul><p><strong>Traditional GPU:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Advanced Caching Mechanisms:</strong> GPUs utilize sophisticated caching strategies to improve performance; however, these can introduce latency due to cache misses and require careful management of memory access patterns.</li><li><strong>Specialised Cores:</strong> Modern GPUs often include specialized cores (e.g., NVIDIA&rsquo;s Tensor Cores) optimized for specific tasks like mixed precision calculations. While beneficial for certain workloads, this adds architectural complexity.</li><li><strong>Dynamic Resource Management:</strong> GPUs dynamically allocate resources based on workload demands, which can lead to inefficiencies if not managed optimally.</li></ul><h2 id=3-energy-efficiency><strong>3.

This is achieved through a simplified architecture and reduced reliance on external memory.</li></ul><p><strong>Traditional GPU:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Power Consumption Challenges:</strong> Although powerful, GPUs’ complex architectures and dependence on high-bandwidth external memory can lead to higher power consumption—especially significant in large-scale AI applications where energy costs matter.</li></ul></li></ul><hr><h3 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h3><p>In a landscape where rapid inference and energy efficiency are critical, the evolution from traditional GPUs to specialized LPUs marks a significant shift for AI and machine learning. With deterministic architectures, optimized memory hierarchies, and tailored control units, LPUs offer promising improvements for LLM inference. As the industry pushes the boundaries of performance, innovations like these may redefine real-time AI processing, unlocking unprecedented levels of efficiency and scalability.</p><hr></content><p></p><p><a href='mailto:%20adeshingle@gmail.com?subject=Reply%20to%20"Faster%20Inference%20is%20All%20You%20Need%21"'>Reply to this post by email ↪</a></p></main><footer><small>Aadesh Ingle | 2025</small></footer></body></html>
